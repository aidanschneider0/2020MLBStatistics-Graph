# 2020MLBStatistics-Graph
A display of the statistics from the 2020 Major League Baseball Season
This program quickly scrapes the data from Espn.com and creates a graph of the AL East division in the MLB. 
This project was one that was done out of passion and a desire to learn how various data science libraries like
pandas, matplotlib and numpy operate. All three were used at different parts of this project, some more than others.
The webscraping process is something that I have become comfortable with as a result of this project.
